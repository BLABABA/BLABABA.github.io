### RDD Transformations and Actions on String
Should consider the string as a list of each character using `SparkContent.parallelize()`. See the two examples below and notice the different results.  

__Example 1__

    def makePlural(word):
        word_rdd = sc.parallelize([word]).map(lambda x: x + 's')
        print(word_rdd)
        plural_word = word_rdd.collect()
        return plural_word
    
    print(makePlural('cat'))
Output:

    ['cats']
You receive a list with one element inside, which is concatenated with `'s'`. Now compare this with the example below. 
__Example 2__

    def makePlural(word):
        word_rdd = sc.parallelize(word).map(lambda x: x + 's')
        print(word_rdd)
        plural_word = word_rdd.collect()
        return plural_word
    
    print(makePlural('cat'))
Output:

    ['cs', 'as', 'ts']
Yep, you pass in one string, it will be treated as a list, and the function `lambda x: x + 's'` will be applied to each character. Then you `collect()` it, you received a list of characters with `'s'` concatenated.
