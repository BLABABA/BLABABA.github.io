I gave a talk at the GW-XL Workshop hosted at Aalto University, Finland. Due to the COVID-19 pandanmic, this workshop was all virtual.  

My talk was about our recent work on acene and acene like molecular materials and their potential as singlet fission materials. I also discussed our observation of the convergence issue of exciton wave-functions in terms of the fine grid wave-functions.
