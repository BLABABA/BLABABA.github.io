## Looking for Singlet Fission Candidates with Machine Learning and Hierarchical Database Screening  

Singlet exciton fission (SF) is a process where onesinglet-state exciton (S<sub>1</sub>) converts into two triplet-stateexcitons (T<sub>1</sub>) residing on two organic chromophores via sharing the S<sub>1</sub> excitation energy. Capable of utilizing high-energy  photons and hence limit energy loss caused by thermalization, SF is considered as a feasible solution to further enhance the theoretical limit of power conversionefficiency (PCE) of photovoltaic devices. However, a practical SF-based solar cell is still  being  incubated partly due to the limited number and class of SF materials. Both the acene and pyrene families and their derivatives are well-known materials undergo exciton fission. Other SF materials such as crystalline 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran with exceptional SF performance was also reported. However, the decisive practical SF material has yet to come after active search of candidates in the past decade, which implies  other SF material might still be hidden inside other  class of materials. Hence, the current bottleneck is to identify more SF candidates from broader scope of molecular materials.  

In order to achieve this goal, I designed and participated in implementing a hierarchical screening workflow to dig out hidden SF candidates with high efficiency and accuracy.
