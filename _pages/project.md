## Fully-Printable Perovskite Solar Cell   
The organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite materials has been widely implemented into solar cells as the perovskite light absorbers. The highest power cponversion efficiency of this type of device has reached 22.7%, far exceeding that of the other emerging photovoltaic technologies such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Most perovskite solar cell devices still need Au or Ag as their counter electrodes, which are commonly deposited by thermal evaporation. However, the usage of noble metals is not favorable for commercialization. In this regard, carbon-based perovskite solar cell, which employs carbon as the counter electrode, has been introduced. Additionally, the carbon-based solar cell device can be fabricated via fully-printing procedure, which is propitious for massive production.

The hysteretic phenomenon commonly exists in the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells with different structures, especially for carbon-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells without hole-conductor. By adding moderate amounts of methylammonium chloride (MACl) into MAPbI3 perovskite precursor, we found the J–V hysteresis of carbon-based perovskite solar cells could be significantly alleviated and the crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite could also be influenced. As shown in the figure above, the J-V curve for MACl-added perovskite solar cell shows almost no hysteresis and presents significantly higher power conversion efficiency.
