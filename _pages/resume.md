## GRADUATE RESEARCH
**Many-Body Perturbation Theory Meets Machine Learning to Discover Singlet Fission Materials**  
Carnegie Mellon University, September 2018 – Present  

+ Designed the workflow for database screening after initial tests of samples. This project proposal was listed as an Early Science Project (ESP) at Argonne National Laboratory.  
+ Implemented band gap classifier and regressor using multiple structural descriptors paired with machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and gaussian process regression.  
+ Acquired a regression model with lowest root mean square error as 0.45eV, which is lower than the state-of-the art model for molecular materials.  
+ Utilized the idea of active learning and implemented a framework of sampling process to change the imbalance condition of training data. Percentage of preferred class was increased from 3% to 6%.  
+ Trained high-fidelity thermodynamic driving force regressor using sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), achieving the lowest root mean square error as low as 0.17eV.  
+ Identified multiple singlet fission candidate materials via screening public database. Published multiple papers.  
+ Collaborated with staff from Intel and Argonne National Laboratory to implement this workflow and prepared to port it into the next generation supercomputer AURORA.  

## ACADEMIC PROJECTS
**Enhance the Band Gap Classifier for Organic Molecular Crystals with Batch Mode Active Learning**  
Carnegie Mellon University, April 2020 – June 2020  

+ Performed literature review to understand the status of batch-mode active learning (BMAL). Determined several schemes for BMAL for further study.  
+ Implemented the *Relevance, Diversity and Density* and *Fisher Information Matrix Reduction* schemes and decided *Fisher Information Matrix Reduction* is more informative given the same starting pool of structures.   

**Fully-Printable Perovskite Solar Cells**  
Wuhan University of Technology, October 2015 – June 2016

+ Ran several tests and confirmed the best ration of CH3NH3Cl into the perovskite precursor.  
+ Photoluminescence spectra shows the strongest intensity with 0.45M CH3NH3Cl, indicating fewer traps and defects within the perovskite crystal, which is consistent with the power conversion efficiency peak.  

## TEACHING EXPERIENCE
**Course Assistant (Fall 2017)** - 24-623 Molecular Simulation of Materials, CMU   

+ Hosted office hours and graded homework.  

**Course Assistant (Spring 2019&2020)** - 27-710 Quantum Mechanics of Materials, CMU  

+ Ran bi-weekly recitations, covered the omissions from the lectures.  
+ Collaborated with the lecturer and decided the progress of the course.  

## SKILLS
Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, C++, Data Analysis, Microsoft Office
