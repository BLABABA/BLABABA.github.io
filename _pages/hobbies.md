#### Sports   
I have lots of hobbies, most single-person sports could have my attention. I started bouldering in 2019. Solving bouldering problem is like doing research, you kept trying and finally someday you reached the top and you start another route. Meet me at Ascend! Other than that, I like swimming and jogging. I enjoy workout in the early morning to energize my day.

#### Cooking  
I loving cooking, mostly traditional Chinese cuisine (pork shoulder, pork feet, marinated beef, etc.) And I enjoy cooking for friends. So potluck yay!
